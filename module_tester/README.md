Use vagrant with libvirt passthrough, requires vagrant reload.

vagrant plugin install vagrant-reload

Also make sure the iomemory-vsl module is NOT loaded on the main
machine hosting the VM. It will cause NULL pointer and spinlock problems,
killing the hosting machine (the device is being managed by two kernels..)

Modify the Vagrant file with the correct PCI id, as found in lspci
